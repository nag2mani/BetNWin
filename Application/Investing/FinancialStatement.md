### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Balance Sheet: *What a Company Owns and Owes*

A **Balance Sheet** shows the **financial position** of a company **on a specific date**‚Äîlike a snapshot.

#### üìå Purpose:

It answers: *How much is the company worth right now?*

#### ‚úÖ Formula:

**Assets = Liabilities + Owner‚Äôs Equity**

#### üîç Example:

Let‚Äôs say we run a caf√© called BrewHouse.

| Category           | Example Value                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assets**         | ‚Çπ20 lakh (includes ‚Çπ5 lakh cash, ‚Çπ2 lakh inventory, ‚Çπ8 lakh in kitchen equipment, ‚Çπ5 lakh property) |
| **Liabilities**    | ‚Çπ8 lakh (bank loan ‚Çπ6 lakh, unpaid bills ‚Çπ2 lakh)                                                   |
| **Owner‚Äôs Equity** | ‚Çπ12 lakh (‚Çπ20 lakh - ‚Çπ8 lakh)                                                                       |

**Interpretation:** The caf√© owns assets worth ‚Çπ20 lakh, owes ‚Çπ8 lakh, and the remaining ‚Çπ12 lakh belongs to the owner.

#### üß© Key Components:

**1. Assets (What the company owns)**

* *Current Assets* (used/converted to cash within a year):

  * Cash, accounts receivable, inventory
  * **Ex:** A retail store‚Äôs ‚Çπ3 lakh worth of unsold goods
* *Noncurrent Assets* (long-term):

  * Land, equipment, patents
  * **Ex:** A software firm owns ‚Çπ10 lakh worth of computer servers

**2. Liabilities (What the company owes)**

* *Noncurrent Liabilities* (long-term):

  * Loans, bonds, lease payments
  * **Ex:** A factory has a ‚Çπ15 lakh loan payable in 5 years

**3. Owner‚Äôs Equity (Residual ownership)**

* Owner‚Äôs initial investment + retained profit

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Income Statement: *How Much Did the Company Earn or Lose?*

Also called the **Profit & Loss (P\&L) Statement**, it shows a **company‚Äôs revenue and expenses over a period**‚Äîlike a month, quarter, or year.

#### üìå Purpose:

It answers: *Is the business making a profit or loss?*

#### üîç Example:

Let‚Äôs say BrewHouse‚Äôs Income Statement for the last month looks like this:

* Revenue (Sales): ‚Çπ4 lakh
* Expenses (salaries, rent, ingredients): ‚Çπ2.5 lakh
* Net Profit = ‚Çπ4 lakh - ‚Çπ2.5 lakh = ‚Çπ1.5 lakh

**Interpretation:** BrewHouse made ‚Çπ1.5 lakh profit last month.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cash Flow Statement: *Where is the Cash Going?*

This report explains **how cash moves** in and out of the company across three areas:

It helps you understand: *Is the business running out of cash or managing it well?*

#### üîç Three Sections:

### üìò Accounting Standards: GAAP vs. IFRS

How financial statements are prepared depends on the accounting standard used:

| Standard                                               | Used By              | Governed By   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------- |
| **GAAP** (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)    | U.S. Companies       | FASB (U.S.)   |
| **IFRS** (International Financial Reporting Standards) | Most other countries | IASB (Global) |

**Example:**
An Indian company will follow **IFRS**, while a U.S. firm like Apple follows **GAAP**. The format and recognition of items may vary slightly, but the principles remain similar.
