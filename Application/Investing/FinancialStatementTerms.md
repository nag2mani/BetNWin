### 1. **Gross Revenue**

**What it means:** Total income a company earns from selling its products/services before any costs are deducted.

**Example:**
If a telecom company earns ₹100 from a mobile plan and sells it to 10 customers, gross revenue = ₹1,000.

**Why it matters:**
It shows the size of the business. Growing revenue means more demand or better pricing.

---

### 2. **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**

**What it means:** Profit from core operations before deducting interest, tax, or asset-related costs.

**Example:**
If a retail store earns ₹1,000 in sales, spends ₹600 on buying products, and ₹100 on staff salaries →
EBITDA = ₹1,000 - ₹600 - ₹100 = ₹300

**Why it matters:**
Shows how well the business itself is doing, ignoring financial or tax factors.

---

### 3. **EBITDA Margin (%)**

**What it means:** EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

**Example:**
If revenue is ₹1,000 and EBITDA is ₹300 → Margin = (300 ÷ 1,000) × 100 = 30%

**Why it matters:**
A higher margin means more efficient operations.

---

### 4. **Depreciation**

**What it means:** A way of spreading the cost of an asset (like machines or buildings) over its useful life.

**Example:**
If a company buys a machine for ₹1,000 to use for 10 years → Each year, ₹100 is counted as depreciation.

**Why it matters:**
It reduces profits on paper but doesn't involve real cash outflow that year. Shows wear and tear.

---

### 5. **Finance Costs**

**What it means:** Interest the company pays on its loans.

**Example:**
If the company borrows ₹1,000 at 10% interest → Finance cost = ₹100 per year

**Why it matters:**
Shows how much the company is spending to finance its operations. Too high = risky.

---

### 6. **Profit Before Tax (PBT)**

**What it means:** Profit after operating costs, interest, and depreciation — but before paying income tax.

**Example:**
From ₹300 EBITDA, if depreciation is ₹100 and finance cost is ₹50 →
PBT = ₹300 - ₹100 - ₹50 = ₹150

**Why it matters:**
Helps understand business profitability before tax rules affect it.

---

### 7. **Tax Expenses**

**What it means:** Income tax the company has to pay to the government.

**Example:**
If PBT is ₹150 and the tax rate is 30% → Tax = ₹45

**Why it matters:**
It affects the final profit a company can keep.

---

### 8. **Profit After Tax (PAT)**

**What it means:** The net profit the company keeps after paying all costs and taxes.

**Example:**
If PBT is ₹150 and tax is ₹45 → PAT = ₹105

**Why it matters:**
This is the bottom-line profit — what matters most to shareholders.

---

### 9. **Share of Profit/(Loss) of Associates & JVs**

**What it means:** Profit or loss from other companies in which this company has partial ownership.

**Example:**
If the company owns 30% in a JV and that JV makes ₹100 profit → This company records ₹30 as its share.

**Why it matters:**
Adds to or reduces the total profit depending on how well its partners perform.

---

### 10. **Profit After Tax + Share of JV Profit**

**What it means:** The total final profit after including joint ventures and associate companies.

**Example:**
If PAT = ₹105 and share from JV = ₹30 → Total Profit = ₹135

**Why it matters:**
This is the **real consolidated profit** — includes all parts of the business.

---

### 11. **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**

**What it means:** Money spent on buying or upgrading physical assets (like new factories, towers, or equipment).

**Example:**
A telecom company building 100 new mobile towers or a retail company opening new stores.

**Why it matters:**
CapEx helps grow future revenue but can reduce short-term cash.

---

### 12. **Outstanding Debt**

**What it means:** Total amount of money the company still owes to banks or bondholders.

**Example:**
If a company has taken 3 loans of ₹500 each → Outstanding debt = ₹1,500

**Why it matters:**
High debt increases risk. Must be managed carefully.

---

### 13. **Cash & Cash Equivalents**

**What it means:** Money the company has in the bank or can quickly access.

**Example:**
Cash in hand, bank deposits, or very short-term investments.

**Why it matters:**
Important for paying bills, salaries, or responding to emergencies.

---

### 14. **Net Debt**

**What it means:** Outstanding Debt – Cash & Equivalents

**Example:**
If total debt = ₹1,500 and cash = ₹1,000 → Net Debt = ₹500

**Why it matters:**
Lower net debt means better financial health.

---

### 15. **Net Debt to EBITDA**

**What it means:** Measures how many years it would take the company to repay its debt from profits.

**Example:**
If net debt = ₹500 and EBITDA = ₹250 → Ratio = 500 ÷ 250 = 2

**Why it matters:**
A ratio below 2 is considered healthy. High ratio → debt might be hard to repay.
