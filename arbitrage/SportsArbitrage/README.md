### 🏀 **Given Data**:
- **Sportsbook A**:
   - Houston Rockets = **$1.80** (if you bet $1, you get $1.80 back)
   - Cleveland Cavaliers = **$2.20**

- **Sportsbook B**:
   - Houston Rockets = **$1.50**
   - Cleveland Cavaliers = **$2.50**

### ✅ **Goal:** 
- To make sure that no matter which team wins, you receive the **same payout** — creating an arbitrage situation.
- The total stake should be distributed proportionally based on the inverse of the odds to balance the payouts.

---

### 📌 **Step 1: Calculate Total Payout Target**
- Let's say you want a guaranteed payout of **$100** (you can choose any target payout amount — $100 is just for simplicity).

---

### 📌 **Step 2: Calculate Stake for Each Bet**  
You need to calculate how much to stake on each outcome using this formula:

\[
\text{Stake} = \frac{\text{Target Payout}}{\text{Odds}}
\]

#### For the Houston Rockets:
\[
\frac{100}{1.80} = 55.55
\]

#### For the Cleveland Cavaliers:
\[
\frac{100}{2.50} = 40.00
\]

---

### 📌 **Step 3: Confirm the Payouts are Equal**
If Houston wins:
- Stake on Houston = **$55.55**
- Payout = \( 55.55 \times 1.80 = 100 \)

If Cleveland wins:
- Stake on Cleveland = **$40.00**
- Payout = \( 40.00 \times 2.50 = 100 \)

---

### 🚀 **Profit Calculation**  
Now let's check the total stake and profit:

- Total stake = **$55.55 + $40.00 = $95.55**  
- Guaranteed payout = **$100**  
- **Profit** = $100 – $95.55 = **$4.45** ✅

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**  
The amounts **$55.55** and **$40.00** were calculated using the inverse of the odds to create an equal payout of $100 no matter the outcome — that's how arbitrage guarantees a profit! 😎
